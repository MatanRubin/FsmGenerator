# FsmGenerator
A simple Finite State Machine generator for C.
A state machine is automatically generated based on the states described in a
user supplied YAML file.
Each state of the machine has 3 steps: on_entry, exec and on_exit.
A skelaton for these 3 steps is generated for the user to fill in its
application logic.


**NOTE**: This project is still WIP, please do not try to use it.
